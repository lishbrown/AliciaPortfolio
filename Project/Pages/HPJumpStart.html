                <p>As a UX Writer, it’s my job to explain complex ideas and concepts in simple language. My goal is for every user to easily understand the content, know where they can navigate to receive help, and if done right, not be left with any lingering questions.</p><br><br>
                <p>Below are some samples of my writing on the HP JumpStarts app. The JumpStarts desktop app was built as an addition to the ‘onboarding’ flow. When users first boot their new device they are guided through onboarding options like choosing their privacy settings, setting up the Microsoft Suite, receiving a free trial of Mcafee and finally, browsing JumpStarts at the end of their journey.</p><br><br>
                <p>The content within the JumpStarts app is tailored to user needs throughout the life cycle of their PC. I worked on a two person team managing and developing content strategy for the app for 16 months. Throughout the lifetime of my work I wrote hundreds of pieces of content for a global audience. I also spearheaded an initiative, developed from user feedback, that showcased deals and specials for PC accessories and more during the heavy traffic months from mid November until the end of December. This initiative brought in over $70,000 ROI during the 6 week span of the content and an increase of 200,000 monthly average users.</p><br><br>
